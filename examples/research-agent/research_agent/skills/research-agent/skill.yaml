  best_practices:
    for_developers:
      - "Specify depth level to control research intensity (quick/comprehensive/deep)"
      - "Use style parameter to match output to use case (nytimes/academic/executive)"
      - "Set reasonable source limits based on query complexity"
      - "Handle conflicting information by assessing source credibility"
      - "Cache frequent queries to improve performance"
      - "Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting"

    for_orchestrators:
      - "Route research-intensive queries to this agent"
      - "Chain with summary agents for executive briefings"
      - "Consider query complexity for timeout settings"
      - "Balance between depth and response time based on user needs"
      - "Use confidence scores for quality assurance"
      - "Implement fallback to simpler research for time-sensitive queries"
      - "Monitor source diversity to avoid bias"
